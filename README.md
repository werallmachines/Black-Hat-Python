# BlackHatPython
Reworked (and working!) scripts from Black Hat Python

Many of the scripts in the book don't work or are outdated. These are my reworks of all the scripts from the book, working and updated (using argparse instead of getopt, for instance). Still built for Python 2.x.

Main differences:
  used argparse instead of getopt for cmd line parsing
  created network protocol to get rid of the blocking issues of original script
  added change dirctory functionality to cmd shell
  added cat ascii art
  more to come
